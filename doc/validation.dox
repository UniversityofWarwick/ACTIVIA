\page valid Comparison of Activia calculations with cross-section measurements

The directory <b>workdir/validation</b> contains the script <b>runComparisons.sh</b>
that can be run to compare various experimental measurements (obtained from the 
<a href="https://www-nds.iaea.org/exfor/exfor.htm">EXFOR database</a>) 
with the calculations from Activia for a range of target materials and activation
products:

<b>
sh runComparisons.sh
</b>

Before this can be run, the <b>analysis</b> program needs to be built, which requires
<a href="http://root.cern.ch">ROOT</a>:

<b>
make
</b>

The comparison creates a series of plots in the <b>workdir/validation/pngFiles</b> directory.

Note that some of the comparisons require the MENDL-2 data files to be present
in <b>workdir/MENDL</b> (specifically the last four examples in runComparisons.sh);
see \link mendl <b>workdir/MENDL/README.md</b>\endlink.

Below are the reference plots. Many of the specific references for the measurements 
can be looked up in the bibliography section of the 
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.3472">Activia paper</a>.
